# Next release

This is a working document where we gather important topics for the next release notes as they occurr to us.
Everyyone forgets, so it's always better to have it written down in a relevant place.
It also allows us to include discussions on the wording of release notes in a PR before the final release notes are published.

Once the new version is released, this document should be reset and we start gathering topics for the next version after that.
